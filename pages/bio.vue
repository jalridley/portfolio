      <strong>Musician Gone Web Dev:</strong> I moved from Toronto to Berlin to
      further my music and event planning career, and after twisting, turning,
      growing and evolving, I am now a Front End Developer.

      <strong>New Rock:</strong>
      Using my indoor time during the pandemic, I began teaching myself
      programming as a hobby and quickly discovered it gave me a passion similar
      to writing music. I was hooked. Throwing myself head first in the pursuit
      of web development as a career, I enrolled in Le Wagon’s Full-Stack
      Bootcamp, kicking off my journey. After completion and a successful
      internship, I began working full time as a Front End Developer at

      thriving on the exciting challenge of jumping from a non-tech career into
      the exciting world of machine learning and NLP. The SaaS app we were
      building was ambitious and the codebase complex. It was a far cry from
      beginner friendly and my brain hurt. I absolutely loved it.

      <strong>Hard Rock:</strong>
      I’ve worked with Vue.js, Nuxt, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, CSS/HTML, Cypress
      e2e testing, unit tests with Vitest, Docker containers, GitHub Actions, UI
      wireframe and custom icon design in Figma, responsive design, UX
      accessibility, writing docs, and lots of code review. I have experimented
      with ReactJS while building a personal project with plans to transfer my
      Vue skills to learning more.

    <p class="mb-5">
      <strong>Soft Rock:</strong>
      I carry with me the skills I have learned along the way from my life
      experiences before becoming a developer - problem solving, conflict
      management, clear communication, the ability to work solo, with a team,
      see all sides of a story, and use criticism as a tool to improve.

      <strong>THE Rock:</strong>
      Determination. Determination is my driver.
